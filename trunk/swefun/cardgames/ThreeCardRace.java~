/**
 * Driver for the Three-Card Race game.
 *
 * <P>The three-card race game is a two-player contest (players A and B).
 * The game is played with a standard 52-card deck.
 * Only the color of the cards, red or black, is significant;
 *     ranks do not matter.</P>
 *
 * Play of the game:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>Player A designates a length-three sequence indicating the colors
 *     of three sequential cards (sequence A).</LI>
 * <LI>Player B designates a length-three sequence indicating the colors
 *     of three sequential cards (sequence B).</LI>
 * <LI>The deck is suffled.</LI>
 * <LI>Cards are dealt face up one at a time from the deck
 *     until three sequential cards are revealed whose colors
 *     exactly match a designated sequence (A or B).
 *     The player whose sequence was matched earns a point
 *     ("takes the trick") and all dealt cards are discarded.</LI>
 * <LI>The game continues by repeating the previous step
 *     until the deck is exhausted.</LI>
 * <LI>The player with the highest point total (greatest number of
 *     tricks taken) wins the game.</LI>
 * </OL>
